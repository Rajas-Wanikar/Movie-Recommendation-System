# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender System** that suggests movies similar to the one you select. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze movie metadata and return recommendations based on cosine similarity.

## üîç Types of Recommender Systems
This project focuses on the **Content-Based** recommendation method. Below are the common types of recommender systems:

1. **Content-Based Filtering** ‚Äì Recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past.
2. **Collaborative Filtering** ‚Äì Recommends items liked by similar users.
3. **Hybrid System** ‚Äì Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering.

## üß† Project Flow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Utilized datasets from [TMDB (The Movie Database)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Cleaned the data and created a combined metadata string for each movie using features like genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

3. **Model Building**  
   - Used `CountVectorizer` to convert text data into a 5000-dimensional numerical vector.
   - Calculated **cosine similarity** between movie vectors to determine closeness.

4. **Website Deployment**  
   Frontend built using **Streamlit** and deployed via local/server environment using **PyCharm**.
